## Workout/Progress Tracking
App for tracking workout attendance and progress, emphasis on mobile layout and mobile-friendly experience
React/Tailwind/Nextjs/GraphQL/MongoDB

## Goal

I created this site primarily to solve a few problems that I noticed with tracking progress in the gym:
- Excel layouts that force users to scroll through a long history of workouts to record a new workout session
- Spreadsheet templates that rely on formulas are inflexible
- Difficult to visualize progress across sessions
- No way to indicate when exercises were completed back-to-back in a superset

## Details

Core Features:
- Choose exercises to perform in workouts and add workouts to your program
- Record results, view past workouts, and track your progress on exercises (projected 1-rep max based on NSCA load chart https://www.nsca.com/contentassets/61d813865e264c6e852cadfe247eae52/nsca_training_load_chart.pdf)
